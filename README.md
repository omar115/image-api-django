for uploading post in website, I created a backend framework using django admin panel and django rest framework. I used React js as a frontend framework. using frontend framework I can fetch data from django rest api, and also I can push data from react and the data can be saved to django backend database.
Summary:
Frontend Framework: ReactJS
Backend Framework: Django
